# Fraud Detection with Verifiable ML

An algorithm is developed for the detection of fraudulent transactions using Cairo. By implementing PCA and the AHP methodology, a transactional risk matrix is constructed. Through feature engineering, metrics are generated from the qualitative aspects of transactions and combined with the quantitative aspects for PCA application, resulting in the identification of unusual or fraudulent transactions.
